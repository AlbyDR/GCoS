The R package rSCOPE, runs SCOPE model from R. There are functions to download and interpolate the DWD data to use as model inputs. Also, to download Berlin Environmental Atlas maps and calculate hourly footprints to extract information about surface properties from raster layers (e.g. LAI, vegetation height and vegetation cover. Organize the model inputs and run SCOPE. Get the parameters (input, constant and settings), calculate model accuracy. devtools::install_github("AlbyDR/rSCOPE")

MATLAB R2015b or superior is required to run SCOPE and the SCOPE code need to be downloaded and unzipped in a directory of your choice. The SCOPE code is available at https://github.com/Christiaanvandertol/SCOPE/releases/tag/v2.0 and the documentation at https://scope-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

1) download the SCOPE 2.0 from https://github.com/Christiaanvandertol/SCOPE
2) unzip in a the folder e.g. C:\Users\Youname\Documents\SCOPE-2.0
